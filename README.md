# Anomaly-Detection
**Anomaly detection Through different ML and DL methods**

<p align="justify"> Anomalies arise due to mechanical faults, changes in system behavior, fraudulent behavior, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Whatever their root causes are, the resulting behavior is critical and may in general lead to economic or reputation loss. Thus, their detection can identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the data set and as such to purify the data for processing. So, anomaly detection is an important problem and it has been well-studied within diverse research areas and application domains. </p>

<p align="justify"> As a matter of fact, anomalies detection techniques are domain specific and we could not find any off-the-shelf method that works in all situations. To develop an anomaly detection system, we need to consider that it is highly dependent on the application area, nature of the anomaly, and availability of the data. Analysis and presented methods help the research community to choose the most suitable method or technique for the specific area. In the industrial system, design and development of anomaly detection methods are crucial to reduce the chance of unexpected failure of a system. It has been found that developed methods for anomaly detection are successfully applied to predictive and proactive maintenance. Such methods are widely used to improve the productivity performance, save the downtime of the machines, and do the root cause analysis of the faults. </p>

<p align="justify"> Infact, anomaly detection has attracted considerable attention from the research community in the past few years due to the advancement of sensor monitoring technologies, low-cost solutions, and high impact in diverse application domains. Sensors generate a huge amount of data while monitoring the physical spaces and objects. These huge collected data streams can be analyzed to identify unhealthy anamalous behaviors. It may reduce functional risks, avoid unseen problems, and prevent downtime of the systems. Many research methodologies have been designed and developed to determine such anomalous behaviors in security and risk analysis domains. </p>

**What are anomalies?** 
<p align="justify">  A common need when analyzing real-world data-sets is determining which instances stand out as being dissimilar to all others. Such instances are known as anomalies, and the goal of anomaly detection (outlier detection) is to determine all such instances in a data-driven fashion. Anomalies can be caused by errors in the data but sometimes are indicative of a new, previously unknown, underlying process that defines it as an observation that deviates so significantly from other observations as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a different mechanism. </p>

**What kind of evaluation metrics are applied to measure the performance of the system?** 
<p align="justify">  "Accuracy" is first important metric to measure the performance of anomaly detection system. However, in case of imbalanced datasets, this metric does not provide a correct performance evaluation of the specific approach. To measure the performance correctly, researchers measure the performance based on True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), precision, recall, and F1 scores. </p>

**Deep Learning for anomaly detection**
<p align="justify"> Like many other areas, sub-optimal performance of traditional algorithms in detecting anomaly and also need for large-scale anomaly detection (gigabytes volume of data) caused that deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithms have become increasingly popular and have been applied for a diverse set of tasks. </p>
