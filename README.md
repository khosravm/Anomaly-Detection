# Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection Through different ML methods
Anomalies arise due to mechanical faults, changes in system behavior, fraudulent behavior, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Whatever their root causes are, the resulting behavior is critical and may in general lead to economic or reputation loss. Thus, their detection can identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the data set and as such to purify the data for processing. So, anomaly detection is an important problem and it has been well-studied within diverse research areas and application domains.
